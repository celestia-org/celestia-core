## Example playbook that configures a Tendermint on Ubuntu

```
---

- hosts: all
  vars:
    tendermint_chain_id: MyAwesomeChain
  roles:
    - ansible-tendermint
```

This playbook will install Tendermint and will create all the required
directories. But **it won't start the Tendermint if there are no validators in
genesis file**. See `templates/genesis.json.j2`.

You will need to collect validators public keys manually or using `genesis.yml`
given you have SSH access to all the nodes.

## Testing

```
vagrant up
```
